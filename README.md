Hosting the Project

Basic Requirements: 
1. Tomcat Server
2. MongoDB 

If working on Ubuntu just get both the services up and running.
In case of windows make sure you have mongod service running in the background(found in bin folder) and startup service of tomcat

Also you have to edit your tomcat server to make 8081 as your default port before you start

You can just download the latest .war file updates and paste it in your webapp folder of tomcat
Go to localhost:8081/Attendance
and its done :D
